## Bookcase üìö

### Description

------------
Profitable writer. Our project will have the name Bookcase, which refers to the organization that offers you a shelf to categorize your books and annotations.
It will be a desktop application which allows us to make any type of literature based on models (songs, verses, books, etc.), which has utilities that allow us to have a composition according to the type of literature to be used. Ex:

Types of projects:
- Writing of books.
- Writing and recording ideas for songs (Text editor, voice recorder, chord recording).
- Poems.
- Annotations and lists.
- Visualization of digital books.
- Personal diary
